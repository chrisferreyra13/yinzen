# Yinsen

Yinsen is an open-source Python backend that automatize your data analysis workflow. The idea is not to invent the wheel, but to at least make a car to go faster from A to B. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

It is built on the shoulders of giants like Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-learn, MNE-python, etc.

I have to admit (creator), it is a little bit bias towards neuroscience data analysis, but should be used for other fields also. 

CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT
